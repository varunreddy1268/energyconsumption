Before executing the OpenCV camera and video reading files, you need to have the following prerequisites:

1. Python 3.6 or higher version
2. OpenCV Python module installed on your system
3. NumPy Python module installed on your system

For Question-1:

1.1 : Run the file the First cell Question 1.1 and you can see the camera gets opened up.

1.2 :  Provide the file name of the video in the second cell and run the code. Then the Vedic gets played using the opencv module.

For Question-2:

2.1 : Run the Neural Network model building cell and build the model for the inputs provided. Then you will get the epoch wise losses. Capture them in the dictionary to save it further to use it in the loss function.

2.2: Plot the loss function using seaborn module and display it.

2.3: Using the model predict the class of the given test data.
